The file Cities.txt contains information about the 25 largest cities in the United States.
Each line of the file has four fields â€” name, state, population in 2000 (in 100,000s), and population in
2010 (in 100,000s). Write a program that reads the data from this file and outputs the name of a city and its
percentage population growth from 2000 to 2010. The cities should be output in decreasing order by their percent
population growth.
